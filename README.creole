Cider is great. But...

As a beginning Clojure user Nic found he wanted to run the whole
program. Not rely on a relatively complex workflow to reload
classes. Also it seemed the right thing to do to him.

So this let's you run {{{lein}}} or run a {{{lein repl}}} in a process
and interact with it.

Nic has never liked {{{ielm}}} or any of the {{{comint}}} modes so
this also has a basic command line interaction implementation. The
lein process output is piped into a buffer and a fixed point at the
end of the buffer is used as the prompt. A simple keymap hanging off a
prefix key ("#" currently, "##" will insert a "#") is used to allow
scrolling up and down through the history.

The command line has smartparens support but no completion.
